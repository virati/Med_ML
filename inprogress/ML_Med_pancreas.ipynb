    "Based off of scientific understanding and data-driven studies, we know there's a link between the two.\n",
    "If the A1c is high, they're very likely to have diabetes. If it's low, they're not as likely to have diabetes.\n",
    "If a new patient walks in and you measure a high A1c $A=10$ you know almost 100\\% that $D = \\text{yes}$.\n"
