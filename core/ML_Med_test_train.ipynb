    "When we have a carefully controlled and measured experiment, there are some pretty simple patterns that our data could take.\n",

    "One way ML takes this into account is with the idea of \"training\" sets and \"testing\" sets.\n",
    "Basically, you take the whole dataset you collected, split it into two sets (not necessary equal), then learn the pattern in the \"training\" set and see how well that pattern shows up in your \"testing\" set."
