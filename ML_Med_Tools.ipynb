    "Machine learning (ML) is a powerful approach to studying nature through data.\n",
    "Lucky for us, ML is dominantly driven by *open source* tools, or tools that are freely available to all of us.\n",
    "In this notebook we'll outline the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a powerful approach to identifying and validating patterns in our data.\n",
    "What makes it challenging sometimes is that there isn't exactly a \"standard toolkit\".\n",

    "In order to learn and apply ML you'll need a set of tools.\n",
    "Luckily, these tools are *general* tools that can actually help you program things in general.\n",
    "In this notebook we'll run through some of those tools and provide some resources to get more comfortable with ML tools.\n",

    "In standard statistics, and EBM in particular, the goal is to design your experiment carefully so that it fits into one of the standard pipelines.\n",
    "Then each pipeline has associated with it a set of statistical tests and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, the goal is to adjust your analysis so it fits the dataset you have from the experiment you were able to run.\n",
    "If the experiment was well controlled and isolated, then ML pretty much boils down to a standard set of statistical approaches.\n",
    "But where ML shines is its ability to extract patterns even if the experiment had issues."
