    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "The goal of science is to understand relationships in nature.\n",
    "The standard way of studying these relationships is to design an experiment to *isolate* the relationship you're interested in.\n",
    "You then analyse the straightforward dataset with a standard set of statistical tools.\n",
    "EBM adopts a similar approach but tries to use very large sample sizes to \"overcome\" the lack of controlled experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Machine Learning** (ML) leverages the modern power of computers and analysis to find patterns in data, even if the data didn't come from a controlled experiment or large dataset.\n",
    "This has major implications for clinical medicine where there is no such thing as a set of identical patients in a controlled environment."

    "### Hands-on learning\n",
    "The unique thing about machine learning is its *open-source* nature. The tools used to analyse data are often freely available. Free as in money and free as in freedom: most people provide you the *code* they used to analyse their data so you can analyse your own data using the exact same methods.\n",
