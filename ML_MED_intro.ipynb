    "The workshop will consist of three sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basics of ML (in Python)\n",
    "    * Installing Python, Installing Jupyter\n",
    "    * How to bring in your own data\n",
    "    * Training-Testing: Beyond Pattern Finding\n",
    "* Applying ML to a dataset\n",
    "    * Using basic and advanced linear regression\n",
    "* Group Projects\n",
    "    * \"Guess the number in my head\" - Using ML to infer patterns\n",

    "The data we collect in the clinical is rarely perfect and our patients are far from identical to each other.\n",
    "How do we still make meaningful inferences from clinical data?\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is Evidence-Based Medicine (EMB) which tries to overcome the challenges in clinical datasets by improving the design of *experiments* so simple statistics can be used.\n",
    "A very different approach is Machine Learning (ML) which tries to find patterns in datasets by improving the *analysis* of data using more advanced statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two approaches complement each other, but the exposure of medical students to ML is lacking.\n",
    "ML is going to become a major workhorse in clinical research because it gives us way more flexibility and freedom to understand pathophysiology."

    "## What is ML?\n",
    "ML boils down to the use of modern mathematics and modern computers to find patterns, simple or complex alike, in data.\n",
    "ML isn't a \"cookbook of statistics\" but, instead, a methodology for you to *design a statistic that is appropriate for your data and experiment*."

    "**Essentially, machine learning is the way we can study complex patterns directly, instead of indirectly through isolating variables**. When we're treating patients we have to understand how everything interacts, not just focus on two pieces."

    "### Hands-on learning\n",
    "The unique thing about machine learning is its *open-source* nature. The tools used to analyse data are often freely available. Free as in money and free as in freedom: most people provide you the *code* they used to analyse their data so you can analyse your own data using the exact same methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that with a simple introduction and a set of resources, you can be well on your way to a life-time of ML learning. That's the goal of this workshop.\n",
